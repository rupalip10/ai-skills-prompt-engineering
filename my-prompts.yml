As we begin initial preparations for the new WhatsApp project, I am currently conducting a requirement analysis to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the scope and expectations.

Your insights will be instrumental in aligning our planning with stakeholder needs and ensuring we establish a solid foundation from the start.
